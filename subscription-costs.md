# How Subscription Costs Add Up Over Time

Subscriptions often seem inexpensive in isolation, but their true cost is easy to underestimate because they are spread across weeks or months.

This page explains how recurring subscription costs compound over time, using simple arithmetic rather than advice or budgeting rules.

## Why subscriptions are hard to compare
Subscriptions are billed on different schedules:
- weekly
- monthly
- quarterly
- annually

Comparing them directly requires converting everything into a common time frame.

## Annualising subscription costs
To compare subscriptions objectively, costs can be converted into a yearly total:

- Weekly cost × 52
- Monthly cost × 12
- Quarterly cost × 4
- Annual cost × 1

This allows subscriptions with different billing intervals to be compared directly.

## Cost per use
If a subscription is used infrequently, the cost per use can be significantly higher than expected.

Cost per use can be calculated as:

> Cost per billing period ÷ number of uses in that period

This provides a neutral way to assess value without judgement.

More detailed examples and tools will be added over time.
