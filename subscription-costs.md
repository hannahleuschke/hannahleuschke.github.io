# Subscription Cost & Breakeven Calculator

Subscriptions often seem inexpensive in isolation, but their true cost is easy to underestimate because they are spread across weeks or months.

This page explains how recurring subscription costs compound over time, using simple arithmetic rather than advice or budgeting rules.

## Why subscriptions are hard to compare
Subscriptions are billed on different schedules:
- weekly
- monthly
- quarterly
- annually

Comparing them directly requires converting everything into a common time frame.

## Annualising subscription costs
To compare subscriptions objectively, costs can be converted into a yearly total:

- Weekly cost × 52
- Monthly cost × 12
- Quarterly cost × 4
- Annual cost × 1

This allows subscriptions with different billing intervals to be compared directly.

## Cost per use
If a subscription is used infrequently, the cost per use can be significantly higher than expected.

Cost per use can be calculated as:

> Cost per billing period ÷ number of uses in that period

This provides a neutral way to assess value without judgement.

## Tool to Use

If you want to calculate annual costs, cost per use, and breakeven usage automatically for multiple subscriptions, a spreadsheet-based calculator is available here:

The Subscription Cost & Breakeven Calculator is a structured Excel spreadsheet designed to give you a clear, objective view of your recurring subscription costs.

Subscriptions are often difficult to compare because they are billed on different schedules and used at different rates. This tool solves that problem by converting all subscriptions into consistent, comparable numbers. By entering basic details such as billing frequency, charge amount, usage, and renewal dates, the spreadsheet automatically calculates the true annual cost of each subscription, the cost per use, and the number of uses required to meet a defined breakeven threshold.

The calculator also ranks subscriptions to highlight those that are the most expensive overall and those that offer the poorest value based on usage. Renewal dates are tracked so subscriptions that are approaching their next charge can be reviewed before payment occurs.

All calculations are fully automated and formula-based. There is no subjective scoring, advice, or budgeting logic — the spreadsheet functions purely as a calculation engine, allowing the numbers to speak for themselves. Input cells are clearly marked, and the structure is designed to be simple to use while handling complex calculations in the background.

This tool is ideal for anyone who wants to understand where their subscription spending is going, compare services objectively, and make informed decisions about which subscriptions to keep, review, or cancel before renewal.
